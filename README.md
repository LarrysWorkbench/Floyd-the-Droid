This is the Python code for the Floyd-the-Droid project on @LarrysWorkbench channel on YouTube.
I've had a lot of fun developing this and it's definitely a work in progress. This is my first program in Python.
I expect that I'll be making changes to this code regularly, I'll try to remember to change the date when I do.
