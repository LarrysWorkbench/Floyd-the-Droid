This is the Python code for the Floyd-the-Droid project on YouTube. Floyd is a fully conversational robot that uses a Raspberry Pi 4B to connect to OpenAI GPT 4o.
Floyd speaks 50 languages and his IQ is somewhere around 155. https://www.youtube.com/@LarrysWorkbench.
I've had a lot of fun developing this and it's definitely a work in progress. This is my first program in Python.
I expect that I'll be making changes to this code regularly. I'll try to remember to change the date when I do.
